Qore json module

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Qore json module provides JSON functionality to Qore.  This was previously
part of the main qore library but moved to this module in qore v0.8.1 

see docs for more information


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.1+ to build and run

to configure the build, execute
   	configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)
