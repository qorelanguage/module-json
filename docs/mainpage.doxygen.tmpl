    @section jsonintro Introduction

    The json module allows for easy serialization and deserialization between <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> strings and %Qore data structures.  The module also provides functions for @ref JSONRPC support as well as a @ref Qore::Json::JsonRpcClient "JsonRpcClient" class for easier integration with JavaScript clients.

    Overview of the functionality provided by this module:
    - classes:
      - @ref Qore::Json::JsonRpcClient "JsonRpcClient"
    - functions:
      - @ref make_json()
      - @ref parse_json()
      - @ref make_jsonrpc_error()
      - @ref make_jsonrpc_request()
      - @ref make_jsonrpc_response()
    - user modules:
      - <a href="../../JsonRpcConnection/html/index.html">JsonRpcConnection</a>
      - <a href="../../JsonRpcHandler/html/index.html">JsonRpcHandler</a>

    This module is released under a choice of two licenses:
    - <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL 2.1</a>
    - MIT (see COPYING.MIT in the source distribution for more information)
    .
    The module is tagged as such in the module's header (meaning it can be loaded unconditionally regardless of how the %Qore library was initialized).

    To use the module in a %Qore script, use the \c %%requires directive as follows:
    @code %requires json @endcode

    Also included with the binary json module:
    - <a href="../../JsonRpcConnection/html/index.html">JsonRpcConnection</a> user module
    - <a href="../../JsonRpcHandler/html/index.html">JsonRpcHandler</a> user module

    @note JSON functionality was included in the main %Qore shared library until version 0.8.1, at which time the code was removed to make this module.

    |!JSON-RPC Type|!%Qore Type|!Description
    |\c string|\c string|direct conversion
    |\c number|\c int or \c float|if the JSON number is an integer, it is converted as an \c int, otherwise as a \c float

    This following functions provide automatic JSON serialization and deserialization:

    <b>Functions For JSON Serialization and Deserialization</b>
    |!Function Name|!Description
    |@ref make_json()|Serializes qore data into a JSON string with optional verbose whitespace formatting for easier human readability

    @section JSONRPC JSON-RPC

    JSON-RPC is a lightweight but powerful JSON over HTTP web service protocol.
    The json module includes builtin support for several versions of the JSON-RPC protocol; the default protocol version used is \c "2.0" unless explicitly changed in the @ref Qore::Json::JsonRpcClient::constructor() "JsonRpcClient::constructor()".

    <b>Classes Providing JSON-RPC Functionality</b>
    |!Class|!Description
    |@ref Qore::Json::JsonRpcClient "JsonRpcClient"|For communicating with JSON-RPC servers

    <b>Functions Providing JSON-RPC Functionality</b>
    |!Function Name|!Description
    |@ref make_jsonrpc_error()|a generic JSON-RPC error response string from the parameters passed with optional verbose whitespace formatting for easier human readability
    |@ref make_jsonrpc_request()|Creates a JSON-RPC request string from the parameters passed with optional verbose whitespace formatting for easier human readability
    |@ref make_jsonrpc_response()|Creates a JSON-RPC response string from the parameters passed with optional verbose whitespace formatting for easier human readability

    <b>Deprecated JSON-RPC Functions</b>
    |!Deprecated Function Name|!New Function Name
    |@ref makeFormattedJSONRPC11ErrorString()|support for the non-published JSON-RPC 1.1 protocol was deprecated in json 1.7

    @section codetags Function and Method Tags

    @subsection NOOP NOOP

    Code with this flag makes no calculations, but rather returns a constant value. This flag is given to function and method variants that return a default value depending on the type of argument(s).  When variants with this flag are resolved at parse time, a \c "call-with-type-errors" warning is raised (assuming this warning is enabled), unless \c PO_REQUIRE_TYPES or \c PO_STRICT_ARGS is set.  If \c PO_REQUIRE_TYPES or \c PO_STRICT_ARGS is set, then these variants are inaccessible at parse time; resolving to a variant with this flag set at parse time causes an exception to be thrown.

    These variants are included for backwards-compatibility with qore prior to version 0.8.0 for functions that would ignore type errors in arguments.

    This tag is equal to @ref RUNTIME_NOOP, except no runtime effect is caused by resolving a function or method tagged with \c NOOP at runtime; this tag only affects parse time resolution.

    @subsection RUNTIME_NOOP RUNTIME_NOOP

    Code with this flag makes no calculations, but rather returns a constant value.  This flag is given to function and method variants that return a default value depending on the type of argument(s).  When variants with this flag are resolved at parse time, a \c "call-with-type-errors" warning is raised (assuming this warning is enabled), unless \c PO_REQUIRE_TYPES or \c PO_STRICT_ARGS is set.  If \c PO_REQUIRE_TYPES or \c PO_STRICT_ARGS is set, then these variants are inaccessible; resolving to a variant with this flag set at parse time or run time causes an exception to be thrown.

    These variants are included for backwards-compatibility with qore prior to version 0.8.0 for functions that would ignore type errors in arguments.

    This tag is equal to @ref NOOP, except that \c RUNTIME_NOOP is also enforced at runtime.

    @subsection RET_VALUE_ONLY RET_VALUE_ONLY

    This flag indicates that the function or method has no side effects; it only returns a value, for example.

    This tag is identical to @ref CONSTANT except that functions or methods tagged with \c RET_VALUE_ONLY could throw exceptions.

    @subsection CONSTANT CONSTANT

    This flag indicates that the function or method has no side effects and does not throw any exceptions.

    This tag is identical to @ref RET_VALUE_ONLY except that functions or methods tagged with \c CONSTANT do not throw exceptions.

    @subsection DEPRECATED DEPRECATED

    Code with this flag is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of this module; if a variant with this flag is resolved at parse time, a \c "deprecated" warning is raised (assuming this warning is enabled).
